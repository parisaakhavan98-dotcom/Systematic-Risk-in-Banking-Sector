# Systematic Risk Analysis in Financial Markets

This repository contains Python code implementing the methodology from the research paper *"An Early-Warning Risk Signals Framework to Capture Systematic Risk in Financial Markets"*.

The approach uses **historical market data** to calculate **systematic risk** through:
1. **Covariance Matrix** – measuring interdependencies between asset returns.
2. **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** – identifying dominant factors driving market-wide risk.
3. **Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)** – mapping the structural connections between assets.

## Key Features
- Adaptable to any industry or market by editing input file names and contents.
- Requires only daily closing prices for the relevant stocks.
- Modular design for reuse with minimal changes.
- Generates heatmaps, network graphs, and PCA contribution charts.

## Practical Use
A useful tool for analysts, risk managers, and researchers to assess systemic exposure and identify the most influential stocks or sectors over a chosen period.
